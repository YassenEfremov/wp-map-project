# Random map coordinates

A simple Wordpress plugin that provides a map with randomly generated coordinates.

The plugin depends on [WP Google Maps](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-maps/). You will also need to add [this](https://github.com/YassenEfremov/wp-random-map-coordinates/blob/master/html/generate-new-coordinates-button.html) HTML to one of your pages to be able to generate new coordinates.
